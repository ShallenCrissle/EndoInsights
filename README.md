## **ENDOINSIGHTS-MACHINE LEARNING POWERED INSIGHTS FOR  BETTER ENDOMETRIOSIS  CARE**

EndoInsights is a research project that leverages deep learning for the improved ultrasound-based diagnosis of Endometriosis.
We use a hybrid CNN + Vision Transformer (ViT) model trained on the GLENDA dataset to classify and localize endometriosis from laparoscopic images.

üöÄ Model Training

The model was trained on the GLENDA Dataset (Leibetseder et al., 2020
).

Training was conducted on Google Colab Pro using an NVIDIA T4 GPU.

Models are stored per epoch checkpoints for reproducibility and evaluation.

üìÇ Dataset

This project makes use of the GLENDA (Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset), comprising over 25,000 laparoscopic frames with region-based annotations.

Categories: Peritoneum, Ovary, Uterus, Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis (DIE), No Pathology

Annotations: Binary masks (COCO-style in v1.5)

Size: ~25k frames across 138 sequences
